  body: "Creating a national index of planning data means that developers, housing\
    \ associations, policy colleagues, researchers and journalists can access the\
    \ data they need simply and quickly.\r\n\r\nIt means less overhead for local planning\
    \ authorities and organisations, reducing the time spent preparing for data requests\
    \ and freedom of information requests.\r\n\r\nWe're working with a number of local\
    \ planning authorities (LPAs) and other organisations through the Open Digital\
    \ Planning community to help them provide data to our Planning Data Platform.\r\
